This is a React Component for easily embedding and playing dotLottie animations in your react projects.

## What is dotLottie?

dotLottie is an open-source file format that combines one or more Lottie files and their associated resources into a single file. These files are ZIP archives compressed with the Deflate compression method and have the file extension ".lottie".

## Examples

Listening for events:

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { DotLottiePlayer, Controls, PlayerEvents } from '@dotlottie/react-player';
import '@dotlottie/react-player/dist/index.css';

const App = () => {
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);

  return (
    <div>
      {loading ? (
        <div>loading....</div>
      ) : (
        <DotLottiePlayer
          src="/path-to-lottie.lottie"
          onEvent={(event: PlayerEvents) => {
            if (event === PlayerEvents.Ready) {
              setLoading(false);
            }
          }}
          autoplay
          loop
        >
          <Controls />
        </DotLottiePlayer>
      )}
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
```

Getting player instance and calling methods:

```jsx
import React, { useRef } from 'react';
import { DotLottiePlayer, Controls, PlayerEvents } from '@dotlottie/react-player';
import '@dotlottie/react-player/dist/index.css';

const App = () => {
  const lottieRef = useRef<DotLottieRefProps>();

  return (
    <div>
      <DotLottiePlayer
        lottieRef={lottieRef}
        src="/path-to-lottie.lottie"
        onEvent={(event: PlayerEvents) => {
          if (event === PlayerEvents.Ready) {
            // Play next animation.
            lottieRef.current?.next();
          }
        }}
        autoplay
        loop
      >
        <Controls />
      </DotLottiePlayer>
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
```

- [lottie-react](https://github.com/LottieFiles/lottie-react): A React component for the Lottie Web player.
- [lottie-vue](https://github.com/LottieFiles/lottie-vue): A Vue component for the Lottie player.
- [svelte-lottie-player](https://github.com/LottieFiles/svelte-lottie-player): Lottie player component for use with Svelte.
- [jLottie](https://github.com/LottieFiles/jlottie): jLottie is suitable as a general-purpose Lottie player, though it implements a subset of the features in the core player. This approach leads to a tiny footprint and great performance.
- [lottie-interactivity](https://github.com/LottieFiles/lottie-interactivity): This is a small library to add scrolling, cursor interactivity, and interaction chaining to your Lottie animations.
- [lottie-js](https://github.com/LottieFiles/lottie-js): The library consists of methods to map the Lottie JSON to the object model and interact with properties, as well as manipulate them.
